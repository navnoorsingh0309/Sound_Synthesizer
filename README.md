# Sound-Synthesizer

## Overview
This is a C++ application built using the wxWidgets toolkit that allows users to synthesize sound by interfering waves of different waveforms. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interactively create and manipulate sound waves, adjust parameters such as frequency and amplitude, and listen to the synthesized sound in real-time.

## Features
- Synthesize sound by interfering waves of different waveforms.
- Choose from various waveforms, including sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth.
- Includes modulation and noise patterns to have more instrumental sound
- Adjust parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and phase for each wave.
- Visual representation of waveforms and their interference pattern.
- Real-time preview of synthesized sound.
- Apply low pass, high pass or bandpass filters to adjust waveforms in more versatile way
- Save synthesized sound as audio files (WAV format).

## Technologies Used
- C++: Core programming language.
- wxWidgets: Cross-platform GUI toolkit for C++.
- winmm.dll: Windows Multimedia API

## Usage
- Upon launching the application, you'll be presented with the main window.
- Use the controls and sliders to adjust the parameters for the all dour sound waves.
- You can add enable or disable a sound using "Enable/Disable" button.
- You can use modulation function to have more intrumental sound.
- By clicking "Play" button you can either play any particular wave or overall pattern.
- Adjust the parameters further to explore different sound combinations.
- Click the "Stop" button to stop the sound playback.
- By adding filters you can create more different sound waves.
- Optionally, save the synthesized sound as a WAV file by selecting "File" > "Save As".
